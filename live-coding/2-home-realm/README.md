# Gno Live Coding Session #2

#### Topic: A gno.land home realm
#### Date: Friday, Aug 30th 2024
#### Presenter: [@leohhhn](https://github.com/leohhhn)

This live coding session showed attendees how to build their own home realm for 
gno.land.

The home realm for gno.land is meant to be similar to what a GitHub profile page
is for GitHub. It's personal, and it includes information about the user.

In this specific example, we create a home realm that adds an image, text about 
the user, and also showcases dynamic imports of `r/demo/art` realms. All of this
is then combined into an output to showcase how the `Render()` function works
in Gno.

## Following up

We encourage anyone who wishes to build upon the example given in the coding
session to do so. Please make a PR adding your code to the 
[`followup-work/`](./followup-work) folder, and ping the presenter.

Video recording will be uploaded soon.
